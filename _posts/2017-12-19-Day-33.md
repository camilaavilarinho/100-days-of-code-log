**Today's Progress:** Today I took a time to understand better the IsntaPy code and read a bit more of the Democracy Earth white paper.    

**Thoughts:** I'm taking too long to finish this paper! Now I decided to read on github, because is more updated and for me is more comfortable to read. I hope I finish this week!
