**Today's Progress:** Today I fixed a bug in the code of the chatbot I'm developing, and did some progress in the tutorial of a web application using firebase.

**Thoughts:** Fix the code was faster than I expected, and I started to understand a little bit more of firebase, because I went to a event last weekend and I didn't understand very well how I could use it.
