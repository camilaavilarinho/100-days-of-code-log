**Today's Progress:** With the advice of a friend, I reformulated my interview preparation process, and started to follow a book instead of a lot of different fonts. I'm reading Cracking the Code Interview, and today I read some of the first chapters. After this I finished the modifications I had to do on the instagram bot, I added a new function and now is working as required. 

**Thoughts:** The book is very good and I think that is what I need now! I'm also very happy with my job on the bot, and I'm thinking in send a PR to IsntaPy, because I saw that someone was needing the same functionality that I did.
