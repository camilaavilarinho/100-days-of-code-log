**Today's Progress:** Today I studied to a job interview and read the results of the survey "The State of JavaScript".

**Thoughts:** I never know what to study a day before a interview, sometimes I think that there's nothing to do because everything depends on your projects and life experience,but I tried anyway. The state of JavaScript survey was very interesting too, and gave me some insights about if I'm studying/using the best technologies.
