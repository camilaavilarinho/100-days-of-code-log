**Today's Progress:** Today I did a Free Code Camp(FCC) scripting question and started a FCC project

**Thoughts:** I had to use closures to do the scripting question and was very cool really use this in a question, because I had only studied the theory before. I also started a FCC project and decided to use React.js to build the project, so I spent a time reviewing some React concepts.
