**Today's Progress:** Today I went to a meetup of DublinJS group and they did a workshop about Ember.js. I learned some things about the framework and we built an application like hacker news app.  

**Thoughts:** The ember.js generate command is very useful! I think I will try to do other things with ember to learn more about it!
