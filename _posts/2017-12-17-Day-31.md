**Today's Progress:** Today I was searching a way to colaborate to Democracy Earth Foundation (DEF), because I think that a good way to understand more about this is contributing to the project, so I found out an issue where I can contribute. The issue is to create an intagram bot to follow the users that follow the profile of the project and also follow people that use the hashtags related to the project. 
Today I read about how to do an instagram bot and found an open source project related.  

**Thoughts:** I really don't like "like farming", so I was a bit consern in take this issue, but before start I talked with Paula - that is part of the DEF team - and asked her about the intent of the bot. She said that the bot will be use for good, and made sense to me doing this as a way to automatize things and bring people interested in the project.
