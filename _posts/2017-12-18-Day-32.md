**Today's Progress:** Today I started to code the instagram bot for the Democracy Earth Project. I found a good open source project in python about this, it's called InstaPy. It worked very well, but I still need to implement the functions to follow someone by the hastag and follow someone back.    

**Thoughts:** It's very nice see the bot working and following the people! And is super easy to do, maybe that's why the instagram is full of bots hahaha. But people can use this in a different and bad way...
