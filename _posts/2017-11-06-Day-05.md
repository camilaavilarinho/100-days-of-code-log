**Today's Progress:** Today I contributed with pyladies Teresina website, making some improvements in the code. I also read about contribute with Free Code Camp guides.

**Thoughts:** It was easy and fast to do the improvements in the pyladies website code, because it is something that I like and I have experience with.   
During the day I also thinked about the projects I'm trying to do in this challenge, and maybe would be better if I focus in I a less number of projects and do it with a better quality.
