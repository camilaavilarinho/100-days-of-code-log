**Today's Progress:** Today I started to code my Free Code Camp(FCC) project with react. I decided to use reactstrap library as a way to use bootstrap components easily in the code. I also went to a meetup called QuizzBuzz that was a geek quiz event. My team got 4th place! :D

**Thoughts:** I faced some problems to make reactstrap work on CodePen.
