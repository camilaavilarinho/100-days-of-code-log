**Today's Progress:** I'm spending most of my days reading the coding interview book, I'm starting to code more on the paper, than on the computer. But I think this still counts for this challenge, right?! 

**Thoughts:** I'm almost finishing the Big O chapter, and despite of some mistakes in the practice exercises I think I'm doing good.
