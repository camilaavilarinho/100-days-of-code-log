**Today's Progress:** Today I did a coding test for a company, it was 3 questions and 2 hours to finish. I also watched a documentary about bitcoins, very interesting.   

**Thoughts:** I only did 1 and 1/2 questions of the coding test, I think I wasn't good in managing time, so the last question that was the easiest I didn't have time to finish.
