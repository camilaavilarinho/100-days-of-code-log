**Today's Progress:** I tryed to contribute with Free Code Camp Guides, writing an article about blockchain. I also finished the ember.js tutorial from the workshop I went this week. In the end of the day I watched a class in a online course about cryptography.

**Thoughts:** The ember.js tutorial was not easy to finish because the text was not very clear and I got stuck in the end.
