**Today's Progress:** Today I read the coding interview book, and other materials about hash tables to review and understand it better. I also read a really god article about confidence and the Gender Gap in IT.  

**Thoughts:** I spent a time trying to understand an implementation of hash table in C, I realized it's been a while since I've seen C in a code.
