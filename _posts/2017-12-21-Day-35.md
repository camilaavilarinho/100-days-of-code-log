**Today's Progress:** Today I started the day doing an algorithm scripting question, then I read a medium article about node_modules, worked on my Free Code Camp project and on the instagram bot. By the end of the day I read more of the Democracy Earth White paper. 

**Thoughts:** After I read the article about node_modules I stoped to think and analyze how big some of projects were because of it, then I moved some projects to a backup and this saved me more than 3GB of space on my machine! I also strugled a bit to understand the best way to do an API request on my FCC project.
