**Today's Progress:** Today I studied about big O notation and went to a meetup of DublinJS group, they brought Mozilla's developers to talk about dev tools and the new firefox.

**Thoughts:** In the end of the meetup they did a Q&A where they talked about their experiences and it was very inspiring!
