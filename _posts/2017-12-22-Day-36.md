**Today's Progress:** Today I started the day doing an algorithm scripting question, then I worked on my Free Code Camp project and at night I participated of a hangout meeting with PyLadies Teresina for planning the activities of next year. 

**Thoughts:** The meeting today gave me a new fresh of energy and motivation, because I was very unproductive these days. It's always good to be part of a great project like pyladies! <3
