**Today's Progress:** Today I did a bit more of my FCC project with react, I'm doing the visual part now, like the menu and other components. I also read a bit more of the white paper of the Democracy Earth, that is a really interesting application of blockchain.   

**Thoughts:** I need to move faster in this project...
