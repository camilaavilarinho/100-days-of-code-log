**Today's Progress:** Today I watched a very intersting video about how bitcoin works and started an course about software testing.

**Thoughts:** I decided to count the time I spend watching videos/courses and reading articles as part of this challenge, because sometimes I do this a lot and, for coding less I feel like I didn't do anything. But reading/watching is been very important to my learning!
