**Today's Progress:** These days I'm focusing on training to interviews questions, so I read an article about this, I trained with Free Code Camp(FCC) scripting questions, read an article about CSS animation and watched a video about big O notation

**Thoughts:** It was cool to understand better big O notation, I had studied this at university but I didn't pay to much atention to the aplications. It was good to remember, now with a more open mind.
