# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge!

This is a public commitment to code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.  

**Two main rules:**     
* #1. Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.

* #2. Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.

More info about the challenge [here](http://100daysofcode.com/)

**I'll use this page to log my progress:**
