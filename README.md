# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge!    
This is a public commitment to code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.     
**Two main rules:**     
* #1. Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.

* #2. Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.

**I'll use this page to log my progress.**
